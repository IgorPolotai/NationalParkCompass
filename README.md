Welcome to the National Park Compass!

**This is still a work in progress. Currently, the diary feature is not working. However, user accounts and user data such as your favorites do work, so try it out!**

This is a project where I try to create a digital diary and interface for people to record their memories from trips to America's National Parks. 

I use the Mapbox API for displaying a map and the locations of these national parks, React for the frontend, ExpressJS for the backend, Redis for saving session info, and MongoDB & Mongoose to save user data.

You can create user accounts, change your password, and save a list of your favorite National Parks!
